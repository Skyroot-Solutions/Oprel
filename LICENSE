Copyright (c) 2026 Ragul

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy
of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to use,
copy, and modify the Software for any private, academic, research, or internal
purpose.

Conditions:
- Attribution: Redistributions of source code (modified or unmodified) must
	retain the above copyright notice, this list of conditions, and the
	following disclaimer.
- Non-Publication: The licensee may NOT publish, distribute publicly, sell,
	or otherwise release as a product, service, or commercial offering any
	software, application, service, binary, or derivative work that includes,
	embeds, incorporates, or is substantially derived from the Software. This
	includes, but is not limited to, publishing to public package registries,
	distributing compiled binaries for public use, offering SaaS products that
	include the Software, or bundling the Software into a product intended for
	public distribution.

Definitions:
- "Publish" or "Publicly distribute" means making the Software or a
	derivative available to any persons or entities beyond the licensee's
	internal organization, private collaborators, or a limited group of named
	recipients under non-public agreement.

Termination:
This license is automatically terminated if the licensee violates the
Non-Publication condition above. Upon termination the licensee must cease any
use of the Software that is inconsistent with the terms and, if requested by
the copyright holder, destroy or return all copies of the Software.

No Warranty:

SOFTWARE.

Notes:
- This license grants broad rights to use and modify the code for private and
	non-public purposes while explicitly prohibiting public distribution or
	commercial productization of works that incorporate the Software. It is not
	an OSI-approved "open source" license as that term is commonly defined,
	because it restricts redistribution. If you need a fully open-source license
	(permitting public redistribution), consider using MIT, Apache-2.0, or
	another standard license instead.
